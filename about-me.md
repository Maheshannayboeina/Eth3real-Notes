# About Me

### 👋 Who Am I?

Hi! I go by the handle Eth3real. I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and a passionate Capture The Flag (CTF) player. I created this documentation space to organize my learnings, share my methodologies, and keep a record of the challenges I’ve conquered.

I have a strong interest in understanding how systems break and how to secure them. My primary focus is on Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Web Security, and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).

### 🚀 Current Focus

I am currently expanding my knowledge in:

* Active Directory Exploitation: Learning the ins and outs of Windows security and AD attacks.
* Advanced CTF Challenges: Regularly solving machines on TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and VulnHub.

### 📚 Why This Documentation?

In the world of cybersecurity, "taking notes" is a superpower. This GitBook serves as my personal knowledge base. You will find:

* Detailed writeups for CTF events.
* Walkthroughs for box platforms (THM, HTB, VulnHub).
* Cheatsheets and bypass techniques I've discovered along the way.
